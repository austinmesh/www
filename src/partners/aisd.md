Austin Mesh is excited to partner with the **Austin Independent School District (AISD)** to bring hands-on STEM learning to students in Northeast Austin. Through this collaboration, we're empowering young minds to explore wireless communication, electronics, and programming using <a href="https://meshtastic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meshtastic</a> devices.

### Meshtastic STEM Learning Initiative

The **Meshtastic STEM Learning Initiative** was created by teacher Raul Vallejo to introduce students in grades 4–12 to real-world applications of wireless mesh networking. Using open-source LoRa (Long Range) technology, students engage in hands-on activities that foster problem-solving, teamwork, and innovation.

### Why It Matters

Many students, especially those in underserved communities, lack access to STEM education and hands-on technology programs. This initiative bridges that gap by providing opportunities to:

- Learn the fundamentals of wireless communication technology.
- Gain practical experience in electronics and coding by building their own mesh networks.
- Develop critical thinking and collaboration skills through real-world problem-solving challenges.
- Explore careers in technology, communication, and software development.

### Program Highlights

The program follows a structured, three-phase approach to maximize student engagement:

1. **Introduction to Wireless Communication:** Students explore radio frequencies, LoRa technology, and the basics of mesh networking.
2. **Hands-On Workshops:** Students assemble, configure, and program their own Meshtastic devices, gaining hands-on experience with hardware and software.
3. **Real-World Applications:** Students use their networks to solve practical challenges, such as emergency communication scenarios or environmental monitoring.

### Building a Lasting Impact

With continued support, the Meshtastic STEM Learning Initiative aims to create long-term educational benefits by equipping schools with resources to sustain the program beyond the initial rollout. We're actively working with AISD educators, local businesses, and community organizations to expand STEM opportunities for students in Austin.
