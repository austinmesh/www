The node at UT Austin is located on top of the Physics, Math, and Astronomy building on the South face at ~80m above ground. It provides coverage for a significant portion of West, South, and East Austin through it's 10dBi antenna and RAK19007 circuit board. The node uses a Voltaic Systems V50 battery connected to a 20w solar panel making this node entirely self supporting.
