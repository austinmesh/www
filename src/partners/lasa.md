The node at LASA is hosted on their rooftop and graciously supported by LASA Amateur Radio Club. While the antenna and position change slightly from time to time for experiments, this node uses a RAK19007 baseboard with an 8w solar panel connected to a Voltaic Systems V50 battery. It provides coverage for a significant portion of East, South East, and even some areas of South West Austin.
