    <h4>1. What exactly is the node being used for?</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Expands a free, open source, community mesh network using low-power radio</li>
        <li>Enables text-based communication in areas with limited cellular or internet coverage</li>
        <li>Often used for emergency readiness and local community support</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2. What kind of equipment will be installed?</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Typically a small, weatherproof box containing a microcontroller and battery</li>
        <li>A lightweight antenna and a solar panel</li>
        <li>Usually under 2 pounds and compact (roughly the size of a router, but the antenna is longer)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3. How will it be powered?</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Nodes are solar-powered and self-sufficient</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>4. What kind of antenna or cabling will be involved?</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Usually a small external antenna mounted to a mast or pole</li>
        <li>No cabling into the building.</li>
        <li>Typical installation uses either magnets, u-bolts around a mast or pole, or hose clamps. No drilling or screwing required unless agreed upon.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>5. What is the expected maintenance requirement?</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Very low, nodes are designed to run autonomously for long periods.</li>
        <li>Occasional visits (e.g., once or twice a year) may be needed for firmware updates or hardware checks.</li>
        <li>Access terms can be set in writing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>6. What exactly is the node being used for? (More detail)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Expands the AustinMesh community mesh network using low-power radio</li>
        <li>Acts as a city-wide text messaging system, allowing people to communicate publicly or privately with anyone on the network.</li>
        <li>Often used for hiking, emergency readiness, and local community support</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>7. What range and signal coverage will this node support?</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Depends on elevation and antenna, typically 2–10 miles or more</li>
        <li>Helps connect devices over long distances through mesh relaying</li>
        <li>Operates in license-free Industrial, Science, and Medical band (902–928mhz)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>8. Will the equipment cause any interference with my existing systems?</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Extremely unlikely, Meshtastic operates on different frequencies from Wi-Fi, cell, or TV systems and is extremely low power.</li>
        <li>Designed to be non-disruptive and FCC-compliant.</li>
        <li>You can request testing or documentation if concerned.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>9. What are the liability implications?</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The building owner carries the liability, though the likelihood of an incident is not expected to be material</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>10. Are there any permits, HOA, zoning, or regulatory issues to be aware of?</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Permits are not needed for small antennas or non-commercial installations</li>
        <li>HOA or building rules may restrict roof modifications — check before proceeding</li>
        <li>It's best to get written permission if you're a tenant or part of a shared property</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>11. How long is the node expected to stay there? Can it be removed at any time?</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>We will work together to determine a clear timeframe or agreement</li>
        <li>No long-term obligation required. Ultimately, you may request removal at any time, with coordination and time allowance for removal.</li>
        <li>Removal should leave no permanent marks or damage</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>12. Who else in Austin has one of this community's nodes installed?</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Austin Independent School District (4 schools so far)</li>
        <li>Austin Liberal Arts and Sciences Academy</li>
        <li>University of Texas</li>
        <li>Austin Disaster Relief Network</li>
        <li>Google (500 W 2nd St, Austin, TX 78701) coming soon</li>
    </ul>
